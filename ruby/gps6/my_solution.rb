# Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: Gregor DestrÃ©e].
# We spent [1:20] hours on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# require_relative has a local data load path as opposed to require which can be
# taken from an external source.
#
require_relative 'state_data'

  # and speed of spread

    predicted_deaths

    end

    # We are still perfecting our formula here. The speed is also affected
    # by additional factors we haven't added into this functionality.

=begin Reflection Section 

What are the differences between the two different hash syntaxes shown in the state_data file?
  One uses the colon syntax for declaring symbols for keys while the other uses the arrow (=>) 
  syntax for declaring string-hash key-value pairs respectively.
What does require_relative do? How is it different from require?
  Require and require relative imports code into the current scope; it transports another file
  to be available within the current one. The difference is that require relative does just
  that, it requires something within the relative directory as opposed to the full root
  directory or remote directory or path.
What are some ways to iterate through a hash?
  The while and with counter loop, the for loop, the each method, the map method, the times method, etc...
When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the variables, if anything?
  They weren't being used. The methods themselves were accessing its own attributes or instance
  methods.
What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?
  The public private status of methods and instance variables or attributes of ruby classes.
