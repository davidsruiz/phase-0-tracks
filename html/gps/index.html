		<h1>Reflect</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><b>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</b> Their purpose is to give structural and meta meaning to an HTML page. They allow content to be organized into logically names divisions to maintain order for both users and computers. In it's usefulness, the main tag to me provides a way for developers to know and distrubite code that is accessible to more people.</li>
			<li><b>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</b> It is always top down. The order it is written in (unless affected by CSS), is the order in which it is displayed, top-down.</li>
			<li><b>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</b> Snippets save a lot of time! I am already creating a handy list of things to create shortcuts for. It is like auto-completion on steroids.</li>
			<li><b>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</b> When researching symantics, different sites gave different answers. It was not easy to find a consistent view on where they should go or what they should do. Even among recognized sites like MDN and others. In order to understand this concept, time must be given to view various examples of credible sources as well as looking at big name live sites for its practicallity.</li>
