	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>The founder of Tesla Motors and Space X suggested a crazy idea about having form of high speed train in a <em>vacuum, hovering without friction,</em> to achive record transportation speed available to the many.</p>
	<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
	<h4>Pros</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Nothing in mainstream transportation comes close. It promises speed of over <em>700 MPH!</em></li>
		<li><strong>Safety:</strong> When thinking about the hyperloop it is often compared with trains. Fortunately, a hyperloop can't exactly derail.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Cons</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Cost:</strong> Building a vacuum through the country is not exactly cheap. When compared to the costs of trains, people think twice about building</li>
		<li><strong>Safety:</strong> Strangely enough, there is concern on both sides about how safe a vacuum could be. (e.g. accidents would be more catostrophic</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>The Journey</h2>
	<p> This is still far from reality, so in order for a crazy idea like this to work. The following must happen:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The idea must be profitable to gain interest.</li>
		<li>Once profitable, it must become popular, well suported, and gain public aproval.</li>
		<li>Policy must be revised for technological advance.</li>
		<li>States must agree to allowing contruction.</li>
	</ol>
