<p>The website that I linked above is similar to my own. It is very simple, but provides a lot of information in a table. As I searched through the page source, I saw a lot of code and it did seem pretty organized. The code that I was looking for in particular was the code for a table. The table that I link to on my website is similar but much more simple. Within the tables, even though there are quite a few things that I don't recognize, I may be able to guess what they do. I could guess that colgroup is for grouping columns for the sake of formatting. I believe that span is an inline element that is also used for styling. For the most part, the elements in the table seem to be pretty straightforward and used mostly for styling.</p>
